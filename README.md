# Scala.js facade for VexFlow

VexFlow is a javascript music rendering library.  Scala.js is a cross-compiler that will compile
scala code into javascript.  A Scala.js facade is a scala API that exposes a native javascript
library to scala.js code.  This repo contains a scala.js facade for vexflow.

This project is in no way affiliated with the creators and maintainers of vexflow.  So far, it
only exposes the (small) subset of things that I have found necessary to use to do some simple
rendering in an app I'm trying to build.  Over time, this may get more fully-featured.
